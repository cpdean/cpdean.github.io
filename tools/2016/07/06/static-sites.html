    <p>Whenever I try to get started on a personal project, I spend about 90 percent
of the time looking up stuff on what tools to use and the remaining 10 percent
goes to not working on the project.</p>

<p>I’ve wanted to work on a personal site for a while.  This time I’m going to try
out using jekyll.  I had played around with pelican in the past, but there
feels like too much of a learning curve to get started with all of the plugin
hooks and configuration with getting your theme up and running.  Something that
really appeals to me about jekyll is how the fact that it doesn’t have any of
those features means I have nothing additional to learn.  Just another template
language I can putz around with and go.</p>

<p>The only example of an engineer that I admire who uses pelican is <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/">eevee’s
Fuzzy Notepad</a>, and I couldn’t figure out how to setup their blog
locally.</p>

<p>Comparing the two tools, pelican requires a lot of extra stuff you need to read
about, and the templates require you plug in all these configuration variables
all over the place.  Maybe that makes it easier to swap between themes if
you’re structuring your site in a way to source things dynamically, but then it
requires you learn what those dynamic portions are.  In jekyll it looks like
you just do what you want right in the template.  That feels way clearer to me.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll be shooting myself in the foot using something like this, because it
may make it harder to migrate to a new platform or a new visual theme, but for
now getting started is more important than having something future-proof.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-do-your-own-site">How to do your own site</h2>

<p>The two big decisions you have to make are what static site generator to use
and how you want to host your site.</p>

<p>For now I’m trying out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for generating the site,
S3 for my host, and <a href="https://nearlyfreespeech.net">NearlyFreeSpeech</a> for my
domain/DNS.</p>

<h3 id="make-the-site">Make the site</h3>

<p>This isn’t a web development tutorial, so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jekyll new mysite
cd mysite
jekyll serve
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And look, open up your browser at
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/">http://127.0.0.1:4000/</a>, you have a site!</p>

<p>Jekyll builds your site on every file change and saves your website to the
folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code>.  These are what you’ll put on your web host so others can view
your stuff.</p>

<h3 id="setup-web-hosting">Setup web hosting</h3>

<p>I have the domain name <a href="http://conradpdean.com">conradpdean.com</a>, and I want to
host my blog at <a href="http://blog.conradpdean.com">blog.conradpdean.com</a>, so in AWS
that is the name of the bucket I need to make.</p>

<p><img src="/images/static-sites/create-bucket.png" alt="click on 'Create Bucket'" /></p>

<p><strong>Setup Bucket Permissions</strong></p>

<p>By default, S3 prevents everyone from being able to look at your stuff.  That’s
a nice, secure default in general, but you probably want other people to be
able to look at your site.  You’ll need to open up the bucket permissions by
going through  <strong>Properties -&gt; Permissions -&gt; Edit bucket policy</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/static-sites/permissions.png" alt="open permissions" /></p>

<p>This will give you a text box to configure the permissions of your s3 bucket
directly with a json document.  Here’s what you do to enable read access to
everyone on all files in the bucket:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::blog.conradpdean.com/*"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Change the bucket name from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog.conradpdean.com</code> to the bucket name that you
chose instead.</p>

<p><strong>Enable Web Hosting</strong></p>

<p>On this screen you just have to enable website hosting.  Click on the <strong>Static
Web Hosting</strong> heading, enable that feature and configure it to use a couple of
files for the default index page and the file to use for 404 errors.</p>

<p><img src="/images/static-sites/enable-static-hosting.png" alt="enable static hosting from the bucket" /></p>

<p>Notice that this dialog is telling us we can access our site at the endpoint
<a href="http://blog.conradpdean.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com">blog.conradpdean.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</a>.
This is the address we will use when pointing our domain name to S3 later.</p>

<p><strong>Fix error-handling</strong></p>

<p>We don’t currently have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">404.html</code> page in our project, so let’s add one.</p>

<p>We need to make a page to show users when they go to the wrong url on our
static site. Make a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">404.html</code> that has this in it:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: default
permalink: /404.html
---

<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"home"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"page-heading"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>404 - Page not found<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
      Sorry -- there aren't any pages with that address here.
  <span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is just plain old HTML with a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">YAML
frontmatter</a> at the top. The frontmatter
is something you put at the top of every text file with some configuration
variables set that let Jekyll know what to do with it when your site is
generated. The variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layout</code> is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default</code>, meaning Jekyll should use
the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts/default.html</code> to render this file.  Using layout files like
this make sure that every page in your site has a consistent cohesive look, and
also it helps you from needing to duplicate common parts of your site
everywhere like the headers and footers.  The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permalink</code> variable is set to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/404.html</code>, meaning Jekyll should save the generated 404 page to the root of
your generated site with the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">404.html</code>.  This is what we’ve told S3 to
use as the error document, and in other web hosts like Github Pages and Gitlab
Pages the file with this name is used by default through their conventions.</p>

<p><strong>Publish Your Site</strong></p>

<p>I just have a script in my project that builds and publishes my site all at
once.  You’ll need to install awscli to use it:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install awscli
aws configure
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And my script looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jekyll build -d _published_site
aws s3 sync _published_site s3://blog.conradpdean.com/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It tells Jekyll to build the site and save the generated output to the folder
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_published_site</code> and then synchronizes that folder with my s3 bucket.</p>

<p>Jekyll automatically clears out the destination folder <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/">on every
build</a> to make sure old files not overwritten
do not make their way into the published site.</p>

<p><strong>Setup Your Domain Name</strong></p>

<p>Now all that’s left is to configure your domain to point to S3.  Every domain
hosting service is different, but look for how you can add DNS records. Add a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code> record to point the subdomain you’ve chosen to the public address to
your bucket.  The public address can be found in the dialog we used to enable
static web hosting above, but the address will be in the format of:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;BUCKET NAME&gt;.s3-website-&lt;AWS REGION NAME&gt;.amazonaws.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For me, because the name of my bucket is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog.conradpdean.com</code> and I picked
the US standard region, the endpoint is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>blog.conradpdean.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code> DNS record to point to this name, you should be able
to view your site!</p>

<h2 id="what-now">What Now?</h2>

<p>S3 is fine as a cheap web host, but it comes with some limitations.  For one,
there is a monthly cap of 20 thousand GET requests.  This means if you have a
blog post that needs 10 files (the page, css files, images, font files, etc)
then you could only serve the page two thousand times before needing to pay for
the bandwidth. Also, your site will only be served from a single region, so
users outside of that region will experience slower page loads.</p>

<p>To fix that problem, setup a CDN like cloudfront or cloudflare to reduce the
strain on your AWS usage.</p>

<p>Additionally, you should setup SSL so your reader’s privacy is maintained.</p>

<p>Both setting up a CDN and SSL are covered
