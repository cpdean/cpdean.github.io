  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>During the Summer of 2019 I got really interested in Datalog.  It’s a language
that is a syntactic subset of Prolog, with a few constraints that prevents the
language from being Turing-Complete.  As a result, you can’t use the language
for most problems, but it is only really meant for querying a database of messy
inter-connected facts of data.  Because it’s not Turing Complete, every Datalog
program is guaranteed to finish, and a query optimizer can do things
behind-the-scenes to make queries run fast.</p>

<p>The original problem that got me interested in Datalog was <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius">this
project</a> to simplify the underlying code
that powers Rust’s borrow checker.  By describing the meat of the logic in
Datalog, the actual code becomes much more high-level and aligns with the intent
of the rules of borrow-checking, while at the same time becoming less prone to
various kinds of bugs you can accidentally write when traversing complicated
datastructures like internals that represent source code.</p>

<p>A year went by, and despite learning broadly about a lot of different logic
languages, I haven’t managed to approach anything in my own work that requires
that degree of high-level rule management with low-level concrete application.</p>

<p>Last month, Pete Vilter <a href="https://petevilter.me/post/datalog-typechecking/">wrote about using Datalog as the interface to searching
through your code</a>.  He
demonstrated how concise it can be to implement type inference over a language
using Datalog once your parser is able to produce facts for Datalog’s EDB.</p>

<p>While I hadn’t found any immediate practical reason to use Datalog or another
logic language in any of my projects directly, the idea of Datalog as your
method of searching through code is something I could use daily!</p>

<p>Today, most people use basic text search tools to find things in a codebase, whether it’s to find where something was defined, or to see all the places where a function gets called.  For small questions of a codebase this is fine, but it has its limits.  For example, it only works if your code is clean and consistent to find things.  Additionally, it can only help you find the first step in a question that has multiple steps, like “Where are all the places this is called, <strong>and</strong> how many of them is this called with a string that wasn’t passed through the string sanitizing function?”</p>

<h2 id="how-code-search-works-today">How Code Search Works Today</h2>

<p>Let’s say you need to track down all of the possible routes in a service.   For
our service, all requests get sent through this large function body that has a
large number of branches to route the request on to the various handlers.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if (request.methodLine == "AddTransaction") {
    addTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine == "AuditTransaction") {
    auditTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine ==  "AppendTransaction") {
    appendTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine == 'SuspendTransaction') {
    suspendTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine == "RestoreTransaction") {
    restoreTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine ==  'DeductTransaction') {
    deductTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine == 'FlatterTransaction') {
    flatterTxn(request);
} // ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can get a messy list of routes that are supported by the server with:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>grep -R "methodLine\s*==\s*\"\w\+\""
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which says “find every line with a string being compared to ‘methodLine’”. This
is pretty good! But it actually misses at least half of our routes. Why?  Some
of the routes use single quotes instead of double quotes. We could change our
grep to deal with that:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>grep -R "methodLine\s*==\s*['\"]\w\+['\"]"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or we can clean up our code and demand everyone abide by The Standards when
making code changes. It is tempting to demand discipline and rigorous conformity
to arbitrary rules when there’s a systemic problem permeating a community, like
using text to represent literally everything in a computer, but you find a new
problem once you clean up all the code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// ...
} else if (request.methodLine ==  'DeductTransaction') {
    deductTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine == 'FlatterTransaction') {
    flatterTxn(request);
} else {
    // use new macro + class-based request routing
    /*
        ROUTE(Foo) expands to:
        if (request.methodLine = "Foo") {
            new Foo(request);
        }
    */
    ROUTE(InsultTransaction);
    ROUTE(ThreatenTransaction);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Someone wrote a macro to automate boilerplate for new command handlers. The code
you are grepping for no longer even exists after a certain point. You could
graft a new regex onto the old one, but it still isn’t great.</p>

<p>But we’re stuck with grep because text is all that’s accessible to us. While
it’s possible to hook into your compiler’s API, nobody has the time to learn
the compiler API to come up with a way to run the compiler all the way up to
the AST stage, keep the results, then craft some graph traversal to look for the
abstract pattern that represents the routing branches above. Instead we’d probably stitch
together a couple of regexes, gathering results in some scratch files, then use
a text editor to clean things up and stitch them all together to get a
comprehensive list of every route.</p>

<h2 id="datalog-for-a-smarter-search">Datalog for a Smarter Search</h2>

<p>Switching to a Datalog-based workflow for querying code is exciting because it
opens up the possibility to write that same search in a way that looks something
like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>routeEndpoint(RouteName) :-
    equalityCheck(F, SLiteralNode),
    getField(R, 'methodLine', F),
    requestClass(R),
    stringLiteral(SLiteralNode, RouteName).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’d define that rule, then ask the engine for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">routeEndpoint(X)?</code>, and it’d
traverse the codebase looking for every instance where there’s an equality
check between two things</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>... :-
equalityCheck(F, SLiteralNode), ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those two things are given names in the rule, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SLiteralNode</code>. These
names don’t have a semantic value associated with them yet, but we establish
what they mean next. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code> variable is the result of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getField</code>, which would
come from the compiler as it builds up the AST. Put together, the two predicates</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>...
getField(R, 'methodLine', F),
requestClass(R),
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>represent the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.methodLine</code> part of the check <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request.methodLine ==
"AddTransaction"</code></p>

<p>Next we define what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SLiteralNode</code> means in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">equalityCheck(F, SLiteralNode)</code>
predicate with</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ...
    stringLiteral(SLiteralNode, RouteName).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our parser gives us something called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stringLiteral(Node,
ValueInsideStringLiteral)</code>. Which represents the String object
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"AddTransaction"</code> in the code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request.methodLine == "AddTransaction"</code>, and
gives us a way to pluck the value of that string literal out.</p>

<p>So now that all of the terms we are searching for are defined, the Datalog
engine would look for matches. Instead of scanning through messy text, we are
searching for specific patterns that happen in the codebase’s abstract syntax
tree. We avoid whitespace differences, or single/double-quote issues because
we’re now dealing with the high-level datastructure that represents the actual
code itself instead of the text of the file. Additionally, our macro-problem
goes away because the macro is expanded into the same syntax tree format as our
normal text code, so it can find instances that are hard to search for because
of our shyness to boilerplate in our text.</p>

<h1 id="semantic-search-adapts-to-change">Semantic Search Adapts to Change</h1>

<p>This is already a huge improvement over raw text searching, but Datalog is also
better at adapting to code refactors.</p>

<p>Let’s say someone starts to refactor our code to use constants for those
routes. If they kept the constants in a macro, it’d expand to the same
string literals and, depending on our underlying foundation of Datalog facts
nothing would need to change. However, if they started using String objects
instead of string literals, we could add a rule to catch that.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>const string ADDTRANSACTION = "AddTransaction;
const string AUDITTRANSACTION = "AuditTransaction;
// TODO: move more routes to constants


if (request.methodLine == ADDTRANSACTION) {
    addTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine == AUDITTRANSACTION) {
    auditTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine ==  "AppendTransaction") {
    appendTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine == 'SuspendTransaction') {
    suspendTxn(request);
} else if (request.methodLine == "RestoreTransaction") {
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can change our predicate for matching string literals to a rule that handles both
cases:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>% multi-headed rules let us match in more than one case
stringValue(S, V) :- getField(StrObj, 'value', V), stringClass(StrObj).
stringValue(S, V) :- StringLiteral(ASTNode, V).

% Our original search rule, with the stringLiteral replaced for stringValue
routeEndpoint(RouteName) :-
    equalityCheck(F, S),
    getField(R, 'methodLine', F),
    requestClass(R),
    stringValue(S, RouteName).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Adding two definitions for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stringValue(S, V)</code> lets us express the string value
inside a string object, both for string object and string literals.
We update <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">routeEndpoint(RouteName)</code> to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stringValue</code> and now this search
will continue to work during the partial refactor.</p>

<h2 id="text-was-a-bad-choice">Text was a Bad Choice</h2>

<p>The reason why I’m excited about this idea is that while grep gets you a
long way, it requires your code to be extremely consistent and never change
when you need to answer certain questions about your codebase, and it can only
give you answers as a list of lines of text.</p>

<p>This is good enough if you can stop there, but if you need to take those lines
of text and do a second step of searching, you now have to deal with parsing
those results into a new script that goes off and performs more searches for
every line.</p>

<h2 id="answering-harder-questions-with-datalog">Answering Harder Questions with Datalog</h2>

<p>In my case, I want to find routes without test coverage. Remaining in this
text-in-text-out pipeline seems acceptable if it’s the only way you’ve ever
dealt with code, but it trades consistency in one part of the problem (“This is
easy because everything is text”) for an enormous amount of complexity literally
everywhere else (“I have text inside my text that represents another layer of
text so after I escape the escaped text I need to unescape it to feed it
into…”).</p>

<p>For my goal of finding test coverage, staying in Datalog is actually better
because my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">routeEndpoint(RouteName)</code> rule cleanly chains into other rules I can
write! I can write a rule that finds a test that contains code hitting the
server with a particular route:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mentionsRoute(Test, RouteName) :-
    pythonTest(Test),
    pythonFunction(Test, FunctionObject),
    lineInFunction(FunctionObject, Line),
    expressionsInLine(Line, Expression),
    methodCallExpression(Expression, M),
    methodCall(M, AnyObj, 'sendRequest', RouteName).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These predicate facts are kind of hand-wavy, but you could imagine a parser
could read in the text for a function, and it would produce facts for every
python function to describe every line and every expression that’s in every
line, reproducing the AST. Once we have a rule that can go from every test
and tell us a route that’s found in a test, we can find every route that
needs a test.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>routesThatNeedTests(RouteName) :-
    routeEndpoint(RouteName),
    not mentionsRoute(_, RouteName).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above rule would find every route, and find every test of a route, and
then tell you which routes don’t appear in the set of tests.</p>

<h2 id="speed-up-continuous-integration-with-datalog">Speed Up Continuous Integration with Datalog</h2>

<p>You can also build queries that help you in other ways:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>% imagine we've written something to parse the diff for files
% and line numbers
linesChangedBetweenGitRevisions(OldCommit, NewCommit, Line) :- ...

% assuming AST nodes link back to their files and line numbers,
% this rule is a typical vertex reachability query in Datalog
routeTouchesLine(Route, Line) :- ... 

routesAffectedByDiff(OldCommit, NewCommit, Route) :-
    routeTouchesLine(Route, Line),
    linesChangedBetweenGitRevisions(OldCommit, NewCommit, Line).

% this is the rule you can use to speed up CI, only run tests that need to be run!
testAffectedByDiff(OldCOmmit, NewCommit, Test) :-
    routesAffectedByDiff(OldCOmmit, NewCommit, Route),
    mentionsRoute(Test, Route).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So when a PR comes in, or when commits are pushed onto master, your CI tool
should know how to get the old and new git commit ids, and it can get a list
of tests to run with</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>testsAffectedByDiff('abc4f3', 'ccd333', Test)?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As long as it gives you your list of tests in the right format, you can pass it
to your test runner, like</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>datalog_search "testsAffectedByDiff('abc4f3', 'ccd333', Test)?" \
    | xargs pytest -v
</code></pre></div></div>
